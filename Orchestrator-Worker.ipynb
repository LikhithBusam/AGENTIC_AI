    "### Orchestrator-Worker\n",
    "In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can’t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it’s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.\n",

    "### Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph \n",
    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node.

       "## Introduction to Agentic AI  \n",
       "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to exhibit **agency**, characterized by the capacity for **autonomous decision-making** and **self-directed behavior** without continuous human intervention. These systems operate within dynamic, unpredictable environments, prioritizing adaptability and goal-oriented actions to achieve predefined objectives.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### Autonomous Decision-Making  \n",
       "At its core, agentic AI prioritizes **independent decision-making**. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, agentic AI systems dynamically assess contexts, weigh alternatives, and execute actions aligned with their objectives. This autonomy enables them to respond to novel situations without explicit human programming for every contingency.  \n",

Anonymization techniques may fail to fully protect identities, while centralized data storage creates vulnerabilities to breaches. Compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) adds complexity to system design, necessitating robust encryption, access controls, and transparent consent mechanisms. Balancing the need for data accessibility with user privacy remains an unresolved challenge, especially in decentralized or cross-border applications.  \n",
