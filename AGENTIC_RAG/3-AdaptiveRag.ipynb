Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems. [...] When companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning — so much so that the terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed. [...] Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”\\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks \"Task (computing)\") without explicit instructions.( Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks \"Neural network (machine learning)\"), a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning [...] As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline \"Discipline (academia)\"), some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of [...] ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.( The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\\n\\nStatistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.(\\nImage courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory \\n\\nMachine learning is the process of using computers to detect patterns in massive datasets and then make predictions based on what the computer learns from those patterns. This makes machine learning a specific and narrow type of artificial intelligence. Full artificial intelligence involves machines that can perform abilities we associate with the minds of human beings and intelligent animals, such as perceiving, learning, and problem solving. [...] All machine learning is based on algorithms. In general, algorithms are sets of specific instructions that a computer uses to solve problems. In machine learning, algorithms are rules for how to analyze data using statistics. Machine learning systems use these rules to identify relationships between data inputs and desired outputs–usually predictions. To get started, scientists give machine learning systems a set of training data. The systems apply their algorithms to this data to train [...] The newest of DOE’s supercomputers—Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory—has an architecture especially well-suited for artificial intelligence applications.\\n   Machine learning allows scientists to analyze quantities of data that were previously inaccessible.\\n   DOE-funded researchers have used machine learning to develop new cancer screening, better understand the properties of water, and autonomously steer experiments.\\nWhereas artificial intelligence is a broad category of computer science, machine learning is an application of AI that involves training machines to execute a task without being specifically programmed for it. Machine learning is more explicitly used as a means to extract knowledge from data through techniques such as neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, and linear regression. [...] How does machine learning work?\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nMachine learning works by training algorithms on sets of data to achieve an expected outcome such as identifying a pattern or recognizing an object. Machine learning is the process of optimizing the model so that it can predict the correct response based on the training data samples. [...] Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in a way resembling human intelligence, or systems that involve data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. The field includes many different disciplines including data analytics, statistics, hardware and software engineering, neuroscience, and even philosophy.\\nPublished Time: Tue, 08 Jul 2025 19:10:22 GMT\\n\\nWhat Is Machine Learning (ML)? | IBM\\n\\n===============\\n\\nMy IBM Log in Subscribe\\n\\nWhat is machine learning?\\n=========================\\n\\n 22 September 2021 \\n\\n Link copied \\n\\n is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data. [...] Classical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn. [...] UC Berkeleybreaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.\\n\\n1.
